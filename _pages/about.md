Hi, I'm Mukund. I'm a computational scientist with a deep interest in the application of machine learning and statistical techniques for better understanding biological data. Hop on over to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mukundmvarma) to learn more about my professional experience.

I'm currently a Principal Machine Learning Scientist at Caris Life Sciences, where I lead ML Engineering efforts to deploy computational biology and computational pathology models and algorithms.

<!--
I can help with

* data science/computational biology strategy and best practices for early stage startups
* custom algorithms or pipelines for novel data types
* deep biological insights based on sound statistical analysis
* experimental design and power analyses
* better collaboration within cross-functional teams through interactive data application development
* visualizations and analyses towards fundraising, IND or patent filings

<p style="text-align: center;">OR</p>

* you're looking for a technical cofounder for your biotech/techbio startup

-->

I have worked on computational problems in 
* early discovery in therapeutics: target discovery, precision medicine and biomarker discovery
* omics data analysis for immunology, cancer and inflammatory disease applications: diverse genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics data types with deep expertise in single cell RNASeq
* biomarker and risk prediction using computer vision models on histopathology slides
* deployment of models, pipelines and web applications in cloud environments
* biophysical modeling and synthetic biology

My computational areas of expertise include
* traditional statistical methods used in bioinformatics
* machine learning algorithm and model development (classical machine learning and deep learning)
* test-driven software development in cloud environments

The best way to get in touch with me is through LinkedIn.
