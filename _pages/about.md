Hi, I'm Mukund. I'm a computational scientist with a deep interest in the application of machine learning and statistical techniques for better understanding biological data. Hop on over to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/p/mukundmvarma) to learn more about my professional experience.

I'm currently operating as a freelance ML/Comp Bio scientist and technical leader. You should reach out over [email](mukundomics@gmail.com) if you need help with
* data science/computational biology strategy and best practices for early stage startups
* custom algorithms or pipelines for novel data types
* deep biological insights based on sound statistical analysis
* experimental design and power analyses
* better collaboration within cross-functional teams through interactive data application development
* visualizations and/or analysis towards fundraising
* you're looking for a technical cofounder for your biotech/techbio startup

My biological areas of expertise include 
* early discovery in therapeutics: target discovery, precision medicine and biomarker discovery
* omics data analysis for immunology, cancer and inflammatory disease applications: diverse genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics data types with deep expertise in single cell RNASeq
* biophysical modeling and synthetic biology

My computational areas of expertise include
* traditional statistical methods used in bioinformatics
* machine learning algorithm and model development (classical machine learning and deep learning)
* some amount of software engineering.
