Hi, I'm Mukund. I'm a computational scientist with a deep interest in the application of machine learning and statistical techniques for better understanding biological data. Hop on over to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/p/mukundmvarma) to learn more about my professional experience.

I'm currently operating as a freelance ML/Comp Bio scientist and technical leader. You should reach out over [email](mukundomics@gmail.com) if you need help with
* data science/computational biology strategy and best practices for your early stage startup
* custom algorithms or pipelines for a cool new data type you're generating
* deep biological insights from all the excellent data you've already collected
* better collaboration between your experimental, computational and business teams through interactive data application development
* visualizations and/or analysis towards fundraising
* you're looking for a technical cofounder for your exciting new venture

My biological areas of expertise include analysis of all kinds of omics data (with deep expertise in single cell RNAseq), early target discovery, precision medicine and biomarker discovery. I have previously worked on these kinds of problems in inflammatory diseases and immuno-oncology. 

My computational areas of expertise include traditional statistical methods used in bioinformatics, classical machine learning and deep learning methods. I am also able to do _some_ software engineering.

I look forward to hearing from you!
